About Me
======
I completed my Ph.D. study in Oct. 2022 under the supervision of [Dr. Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen](https://petertsehsun.github.io/) and [Dr. Weiyi (Ian) Shang](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~shang/) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) in Canada. My research interests include mining software repositories, empirical software engineering, and AI for SE.
