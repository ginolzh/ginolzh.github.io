About Me
======
I completed my Ph.D. study at [_Concordia University_](https://www.concordia.ca/) in 2022, under the supervision of [Dr. Tse-Hsun (Peter) Chen](https://petertsehsun.github.io/) (_Concordia University_) and [Dr. Weiyi (Ian) Shang](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~wshang/) (_University of Waterloo_). My research interests include mining software repositories, AI for SE, and empirical software engineering.
